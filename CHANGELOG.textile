h2. 1.0.4, released 13/08/2009

* [WCR] Auto-assign Contact#contact_id and Invoice#invoice_id on creation of either of these records.
* [WCR] Add Xero::Gateway#build_contact and Xero::Gateway#build_invoice factory methods to create Contact/Invoice objects associated with the gateway.
* [WCR] Add Contact#save method to create/update a contact record based on if it has a contact_id or contact_number.
* [WCR] Add Invoice#save method to create (insert only currently supported by Xero API) the invoice.
* [WCR] Add #valid? method to each model class to validate it's contents with the minimum required by the API (without calling the API).
* [WCR] Add useful API constants throughout the library.
* [WCR] Allow Invoice and LineItem to auto-calculate line_amount, sub_total, total_tax and total fields. Existing setters for these fields remain (for backwards compatability) but will be deprecated in the future.
